# JSON API clients
Here is a set of JSON API clients written "just-for-fun"
- `api_client_openweather` - Openweather API client pulling local weather forecast from Openweather.com
- `api_client.rb` - JSON API client for book catalog backend server
- `product.rb` - class Product, bit similar to ActiveRecord by its interface, but using JSON API calls to fetch data from backend server
